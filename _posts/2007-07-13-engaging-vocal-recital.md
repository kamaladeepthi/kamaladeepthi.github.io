> **Kasturi Kamaladeepti came up with a memorable performance.**

Popular music sabha Sangeetha Kalaasamithi organised a vocal recital by young Kasturi Kamaladeepti at the Public Library, Visakhapatnam, last week. Marked with an aesthetic effort it fulfilled all norms of exposition of carnatic music in all its richness and attracted applause from all sections of the audience including the critics. More fascinating was the almost comparable exposition of laya on mridangam in his accompaniment amiably provided by nine-year-old Harsha from the US in the company of professionals M. Satyanarayana Sarma on violin and G. Venkatesh on morsing.

Setting up an engaging mood from the word go tunefully starting with Pranamamyaham (Goula) suffixed with crisp swaram, Deepti
evocatively rendered Kamaakshi of Syamasastri (Begada) prefixed with brief but beautiful aalapana, Enthanerchina (Saveri) and
Sarasijanabhasodari (Naaga Gandhari) before she elaborately rendered Pankajalochana (Kalyani) with aalapana and swaram. Then after
rendering Nenarunchara of Thyagaraja, she expansively expatiated Chakkani Rajamargamu of the same composer (Kharaharapriya).

The knowledgeable thani executed on mridangam by the little Harsha along with Venkatesh on morsing with felicitous charm delighted all alike. Sarma on violin contributed grandeur with his scholarly and subtle following. Guest of Honour, AIR Station Director Prayaga Vedavathi presenting mementos was all praise for the artistes. Founder secretary of the Samithi and renowned mridangam vidwan V.V. Ramanamurty proposed a vote of thanks.
