Only age, but not their potential seemed to be the criterion for the vocalists who were scheduled to sing for one hour and fifteen minutes each first successively from second day evening of the Music and Dance fete of Andhra Music Academy at Kalabharathi, Vishakapatnam.

As a matter of fact, the so called junior artistes seemed to be zealously exhibiting their talent, by way of knowledgeably rendering the compositions with clear-cut diction of their own each. Their choice accomplishing adornment of at least two compositions each with manodharma by way of ragalapana either briefly or elaborately, neravu and swarakalpana, was of high standard.

It was eruditely and empathetically commensurable and conformable with appropriate understanding of the ecstatic expressions embedded in the lyrical and musical phraseology of the krithis and keerthanas. They also seemed to hold high promise to continue the trend to get evolved as the maestros of the recent past but not like that of the current practice of plagiarising tendency of most of the so called senior artistes of the present day time.

Second day (last Saturday) evening featured K. Lahari in the company of Mavuduri Satyanarayana Sarma on violin and Mangalagiri Sridhar on mridangam. Her concert proved to be an aesthetically elated recital of nearly 90 minutes, which included ragam tanam pallavi rendered with instant innovation in Rag Maund in Aditalam along with similar Thani on mridangam also.

Similarly, going on with improvement on finish with aesthetic finesse, N.C. Koushik Kalyan from Hyderabad eruditely rendered and made his vocal concert euphonic all the way. He was provided happy accompaniment on violin by Parthiv and S. Janardhan on mridangam including his Thani after Sarasijanabha Murare (Todi in Misrachapu) of Swathi Tirunal.

Continuing to eruditely expounding expression of Manodharma by way of expansively expatiating Ninne Namminanu of Syamasastry (Todi in Misrachapu), Kasturi Kamala Deepthi, systematically developed alapana, neravu and swaram in particular in both the tempos. Equally well played in his chances on violin by Mavuduri S. Sarma and on mridangam by M. Sridhar, it proved to be a thought provoking concert on the fourth day evening.

Duddu Radhika from Hyderabad with evocatively and empathetically well chosen tempo rendered her concert knowledgeably with conscious ardency on the next evening. M. Neeladri Rao on violin and Mandapaka Ravi on mridangam (both from Vizianagaram) accompanying and sublimely playing their chances, made the main item Mamava Meenakshi (Varali) of Dikshitar (Misrachapu) soulfully enjoyable.

Rendering effectively evocative, B. Sai Kartikeya, with Peri Tyagaraju on violin and B. Sriram on mridangam (all from Hyderabad) rendered his concert with Raghuvara Nannu (Pantuvarali â€“ Adi) impressively as the main item on the penultimate evening.

Exploiting her vibrantly melodious and euphonic range of full two and half octaves with the same intensity in the voice and her sensibly knowledgeable art of exposition to the hilt systematically, N.C.S. Ravali from Hyderabad rendered an ever reverberating recital on the concluding evening. Very well accompanied by Pappu Jnana Dev on the violin and on mridangam by G. Venkata Rao, the expansive expatiation of Bhajare Chitha (Kalyani), stood out hauntingly an ever ringing melody.
