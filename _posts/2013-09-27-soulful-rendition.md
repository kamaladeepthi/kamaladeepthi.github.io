> **Kamala Deepti is gifted with a rich and resonant voice of considerable range that she revealed right in the first two
numbers**

Young Kasturi Kamala Deepti, an IT professional, was featured in concert for Kalasagaram at Keyes High school, Secunderabad, last week. Her performance and repertoire reflected her guru's influence , with fresh numbers also added.

She was accompanied by R. Dinkar on violin and Burra Sriram on mridangam. Kamala Deepti is gifted with a rich and resonant voice of considerable range that she revealed right in the first two numbers - varnam *Intha Chaala* in Begada with swarakalpana and the kirtana *Sri Mahaganapathe* in Malahari, both of Muthaiah Bhagavatar.

They revealed her sense for sahitya and neat musical setting for raga and swara presentation. The rendition of kirtana eulogizing Vinayaka carried emotional element annexed with neat and compact swarakalpana.

The Navagraha Kirtana of Dikshitar, *Diwakara Tanujam* in Yadukula Kambhoji was taken up next for raga and swara delineation. The raga had swift and novel moves elevating its beauty.

Prefacing the kirtana with a slokam helped to set mood for reception of kirtana part. The kalpana swaras she presented later demonstrated her creative skills.

Then a Tamil composition *Tunai Purindarul Taruna Madhava* of Papanasam Sivan in rare raga Varamu was set in Desadi talam. Kamala
Deepti enriched the number by presenting ragalapana and swarakalpana. Yet Kalyani was Kamala Deepti's first expansive raga effort of the concert, for Thyagaraja's *Nidhi Chaala Sukhama*. The raga delineation was marked with swift and novel moves matching the melody. The smooth and appealing kirtana rendition was enriched with a neraval at the line *Dasaradhi Gaana Bhajana* extended into neat swarakalpana.

Shyama Sastry's vilambakala kirtana *Tharunamidamma* in Gowlipanthu was like a curtain riser for an RTP in Kaanada, in Misrachapu
talam. The pallavi line, *Pahimam Sri Rajeswari Kripakari Sakalakala Sagari*, ran with a nereval and swara presentation in ragamalkika comprising Kaanada, Janaranjani, Saraswathi and Lalitha.

The presentation of Ragam and Tanam was dexterous. Dinakar’s violin support was uniformly good. So was Tani avartanam by the
mridangam artiste. The final part of Kamala Deepti’s concert had an Ashtapadi of Jayadeva in Raag Shyaamakalyani. She ended her show with her guru Seshagopalan's Tillana in Huseni.
