'Sampradaya', a music sabha, functioning at Malkajgiri invited artistes from Chennai to participate in this year's music festival, held at Vijaya Vinayaka temple.

Young Harichandana, who won first prize in last year’s competitions, opened the festival with her vocal rendition. She was in the company of Sai Bhargav on violin and Rahul on mridangam. Thodi varnam Yera Napai she presented in two speeds and Gam Ganapathe in Hamsadhwani of Muthiah Bhagavatar with swarakalpana was made up into first part of repertoire.

Then Kalyani was taken up for delineation and she displayed diligence in displaying her vocal maturity. Amma Ravamma of Thyagaraja was rendered in this and swarakalpana in end part added sumptuousness. Chakkani Rajamargamu in Kaharaharapriya was another notable number she presented with raga and swara.

A.V.K. Rajasimhan of Chennai figured next with B.V. Durga Bhavani on violin and P. Jayabhaskar on mridangam.

It was opened with Kalyani varnam Vanajakshi in three speeds followed by Vatapi in Hamsadhwani and Pavanaguru in Hamsadhwani that set momentum to the concert. Marivere of Syama Sastry in Anandabhairavi was a relaxed presentation. Merusmaana in Mayamalavagowla opened with elaborate ragaalapana.

The kriti and neraval and swarakalpana in ragamalika comprising of Hindola, Chandrakauns and Sunandavinodini were appealing.

Manda Sudharani of Visakhapatnam appeared another day and opened her concert with Bhairavi Viriboni varnam of Adi Appayya presenting poorvangam in Panchanada and Uttarangam in Misranada, a curious exercise. Ganasudharasasa in Nata of Balamurali in praise of Thyagaraja figured next.

The neraval and swarakalpana made it lustrous. After Yenthani Vinnavinthura in Oormika, Bhogindra Sayinam in Kuntalavarali and Brovabharama in Bahudari she chose to present Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi in Hindolam.

She adopted a novel method in presenting Pallavi and neraval in contrasting speeds — pallavi in lower speed and neraval faster and vice versa. Sarasamaina Matalento in Behag and Kadanakutuhalam tillana, concluded her presentation.

Kasturi Kamala Deepti, disciple of T.N. Seshagopalan sang with Dinakar on violin and Burra Sriram on mridangam.

She opened her concert with Suddha Dhanyasi varnam of Muthiah Bhagavatar and followed it with Dikshitar's Mahaganapathi in Gowla. Renditions of Maanamu Kavalenu Talli in Sahana and Brovavamma in Maanji of Syama Sastry led her to elaborate Kalyani for Etavunara popular number of Thyagaraja was her choice. Both the raga essay and swarakalpana enlivened the spirit of composition.

She presented Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi in Saveri notable for the pallavi line Kali Kalabha Mukham Sumukham Bhavaye, Varadayakam Vinayakam in Khanda jhmpe talam in Khandagati. The swarakalpana in raga chain of Bilahari, Karnaranjani, Behag and Kapi was a treat.

The accompanist was supportive all through.

Jonnalagadda Satya Sriram, disciple of Akella Mallikarjuna Sarma rounded off the festival with his vocal concert. Natakuranji varnam, Chelamela in two speeds and Siddhi Vinayakam in Shanmukhapriya for Dikshitar set positive tone to the concert.

The other numbers that enriched his concert were Paridanamichite in Bilahari of Patnam was followed by Muthaiah Bhagavatar’s kirtana in Hindolam with Raga and Nereval adapting grahabedham and swarakalpana concluding the number.

Mridangam artiste Aravind’s tani avartanam and his general support and violinist Saikumar’s supportive contribution stood by the concert.
