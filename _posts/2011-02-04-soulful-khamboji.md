> **Kamala Deepti impressed with a crisp rendition.**

Swarajhari presented a vocal concert by Kasturi Kamala Deepti of Visakhapatnam, who received her musical training from Pantula Rama. The young singer is pursuing her masters in Information Technology in Chennai and is under the guidance of Padma Bhushan awardee T.N. Seshagopalan. She has already, at the age of 22, received many awards and accolades from several sabhas in the country. The concert was held at Sringeri Peetha Paripalita Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram, Vijayawada.

Starting with crisp saveri varnam, Kamala Deepti next sang Abhayambaya of Dikshitar, complimenting it with fine raga delineation. This was followed by Muthiah Bhagavatar's composition Sarasadala Nayana in Saramathi. Ninnu vinaga, a beautiful composition of Syamasastri in Poorvikalyani was sung as the sub main with fine raga version and swaras.

For the main item, Kamala Deepti took up the majestic composition of Thyagaraja in Kambhoji O Rangasayi. The raga delineation was
exhaustive. The niraval and swaras were also brilliantly rendered. B.V. Durgabhavani and K. Sai Giridhar supported efficiently on violin and mridangam respectively. Another attractive piece in the concert was Madurai G.S. Mani's composition Palimpa Tamasama in Sivaranjani.
